title: React Native Mobile App
---

## About

I really loved the concept of having javascript framework to write mobile application. So if you are web developer you can easily make mobile apps as well. I have made the small react native mobile app with Android Studio and Expo. It is great for developer's productivity and much faster to develop and easier to debug compared to Android project with gradle. This is not full fledged application and I just wanted to get hands on react native.
